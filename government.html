			<h3>Government and Infrastructure</h3>
			<p>Two Houston City Council districts, F and J, serve the new Chinatown. District J was created to allow Hispanics to more easily elect representatives who cater to them.</p>

			<p>The new Chinatown is served by two Houston Police Department patrol divisions, the Midwest Patrol Division and the Westside Patrol Division, of the Houston Police Department. The Midwest division operates the Ranchester Storefront (Simplified Chinese: 中国城警察局, Hanyu Pinyin: Zhōngguóchéng Jǐngchájú "Chinatown Police Station") in the Diho Square (Simplified Chinese: 顶好广场, Hanyu Pinyin: Dínghǎo Guángchǎng) complex.</p>

			<p>Fire stations located within Chinatown's boundaries include Station 10 Bellaire (Simplified Chinese: 第十号消防队, Hanyu Pinyin: Dìshíhào Xiāofángduì "Fire Brigade #10") and Station 76 Alief Community, both a part of Fire District 83. Station 10, previously located in what is now East Downtown, relocated to its current location in 1985. Station 76 was built in 1985.</p>
